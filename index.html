            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>
                Welcome to the MonoDialogue game. This is a one-player game where the player
                will play two characters, Glenn and Morgan, simultaneously.
            </p>

            <h4>What you will do</h4>
            <p>
                The rule is simple. You will write dialogue into the textbox for one of the characters
                at a time, and they will alternate speaking with each other. Some events might pop up as
                messages in the story. You may choose to incorporate the events into the dialogue, or
                ignore the events, just like in real conversations! When writing the dialogue, you can end
                the dialogue by either clicking the button "speak", or hit "Enter" on your keyboard. You
                can choose whatever ways the dialogue goes!
            </p>

            <p>
                You have a chance to try out the Sample game first. The Sample game will be
                disabled when you click "Start". Click on the "Start" button if you want to
                play the real game.
            </p>
                
            <h4>Time</h4>
            <p>
                There is a clock that tells you what is the time in the game. The clock in the game will start
                at 1:20 pm, and you have until 1:38 pm to talk to each other. The clock will start when Glenn
                finishes "speaking" the first dialogue that you write into the textbox. When the clock hits
                1:30 pm, each character would not be able to speak with each other anymore.
            </p>

            <h4>Character Information</h4>
            <p>
                The information about each character you play is at the bottom of the page. You would probably
                have to scroll down to reach there. Other than the information listed below, feel free to
                go in whichever direction you want! 
                <b>Please read the character information at the bottom of the page before the game starts!</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Remark: Hitting refresh on the browser will RESTART the whole game!

            <h3>Sample Story</h3>
            <p>
                Here is a sample part to try out the game. Note that in the real game,
                the clock will start at 1:20 pm. Like the real game, the clock will stop
                at 1:30 pm. It is highly recommended that new players play this sample game
                first to get a feel of what it is like to play the game.
            </p>

                Glenn: Hello is pronounced as H-E-L-L-O.

            <p>
                Morgan: Woah! How cool is that?!

            <h3>The Game</h3>

            <p>
                Today is the first day of the quarter for Glenn and Morgan. They might not
                be enthusiastic about the first day of quarter, but at least they want to
                meet new people. They somehow end up next to each other in the college's
                cafeteria, and they never met each other before.

                Glenn: Erm... May I sit here?
            </p>

            <p>
                Morgan: Yeah, sure!
